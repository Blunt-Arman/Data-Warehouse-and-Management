🗄️ Data Warehouse and Management

This repository contains various Python programs and practical exercises developed as part of the Data Warehouse and Management (DWM) course.
Each folder focuses on a specific data analysis, visualization, or machine learning concept — from basic descriptive statistics to clustering and regression models.
